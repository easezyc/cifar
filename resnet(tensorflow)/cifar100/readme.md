Based on tensorflow example, I change the cifar10 code to adapt cifar100. In `resnet_model.py`, you can change the block(building_block or bottleneck_block). I recommend you use bottleneck, and it can achieve `77%` accuracy on cifar100. In addition, I use the code to try using word embedding as taget to train the network. If you just want run cifar100 without word embedding, you can run the cifar100_normaltrain.py. I recommend you use L2 8E-4.
